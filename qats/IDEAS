# query gateway
# instance with helper functions to subscribe
# query gateway should spawn instance
	- which will act as tickerplant gateway
	- will also act as a relay for hdb and rdb data
	- should PUSH all data so that node is agnostic to data source
# controller node
	- request a new execution
	- manages execution reporting
	- starts a new data node (which uses the query gateway; or can initially just subscribe to tickerplants)
	- starts a new execution node

# execution node
	- is started wrapped by execution.q
	- exposes a dictionary of subscriptions
		- allowed to add subscriptions later? .. could do.. just more tp subs if rt, more complicated if not
	- somehow hide hopen from wider use?  i.e. cut down q.k ?
	- implements a function tick[dataDictionary;nowTimestamp] 
	- no possibility yet for connected sets of nodes... initially all calculation must be done in single node
	- execution node can publish ticks (initially maybe configure target for these? later allow subscriptions)
	- how do you manage time based rather than data driven ticks ?
		- could use milli timer on execution node (no guarantee... but can there ever be?)
		- could use seperate instance... but likely need it to be same instance to ensure ordering
		- instance itself would iterate through pushed data... how would it know to iterate?
		- rcv and tick being two different things? i.e. rcv is a new set of data being pushed whereas tick is the local calculation
		- ** therefore inside rcv you can order the timed event within the received data **
			- what happens to a timer if the thread is busy when the timer should occur
			- don't use the timer? simply take current source time and add +T; then add this event to the queue
			- using this in realtime could prove problematic?  need to use the timer as well to invoke any events which remain
			... so
			- add T+ event to event queue
			- timer runs every milli and invokes anything which should have gone through

# v1
	- realtime data only
	- pushed to execution node from data node
	- both started manually
	
# v2
 	- controller node which starts and manages executions of other nodes

# v3
	- timed data for callbacks

# v4
	- historic data
